1. As discussed in the brief blog post, sometimes we might overfit according to random patterns in our data (e.g. having too many movies with Brad Pitt). By creating a random forest, we lessen that problem.
2. My random forest as currently implemented takes about 3 minutes 20 seconds to complete on the pulsar data set.
3. I was able to get an accuracy of around 90%.
